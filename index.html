            <h2>Questions and Answers</h2>
<details>
    <summary>Who, when, and why was the lubricating material "MARIOL NT" created?</summary>
    <div>The lubricating material "MARIOL NT" was developed in 2020 in collaboration with companies LLC NVF "YUGTEKHNOTRANS", LLC "MODIFIK", and lubricating material manufacturers LLC "SLAVOYL" and LLC "SLAVNEFTEKhim".<br>
        <br>The creation of this material was prompted by a sudden increase in wear of industrial railway transport wheel ridges, frequent cases of locomotives derailing due to increased wheel ridge friction on rails, and a significant increase in fuel-energy resource consumption due to the lack of a modern lubricating material for the "wheel-rail" pair that meets modern operating requirements. The purpose of creating "MARIOL NT" is to reduce the intensity of wear on the friction surfaces of the "wheel-rail" pair of industrial railway transport and to increase the safety and energy efficiency of freight railway transport.</div>
</details>
<details>
    <summary>What research (tests) preceded the creation of the lubricating material "MARIOL NT"?</summary>
    <div>Prior to the creation of the lubricating material, all necessary research and tests prescribed by state standards and sanitary norms were conducted.
        In April 2019, comparative bench tests of "MARIOL NT" lubricating material prototypes and other materials for the "wheel-rail" pair used in "Ukrzaliznytsia" production facilities were conducted in the tribological laboratory of Dnipro National Technical University with the participation of "Ukrzaliznytsia" representatives.
        According to the commission's conclusion, "MARIOL NT" demonstrated significantly less wear compared to other materials.<br>
        <br>
        After successful bench tests, the "MARIOL NT" prototypes were approved for operational tests under real conditions on a locomotive equipped with the grease-ridge system SPP 12-5 from LLC NVF "YUGTEKHNOTRANS".
        After completing the operational tests from April 2019 to January 2021, "MARIOL NT" demonstrated effectiveness in reducing wear of the "wheel-rail" pair and decreasing the intensity of these processes.
        Based on the results of these tests, a decision was made to create, test, and implement the lubricating material under the working name "MARIOL NT".</div>
</details>
<details>
    <summary>What sets "MARIOL NT" apart from domestic and foreign counterparts?</summary>
    <div>In terms of its anti-wear and operational qualities, "MARIOL NT" has no domestic counterparts and surpasses many well-known foreign analogs. Due to the presence of solid lubricating fillers TU U 20.5-001-42277844:2019, "MARIOL NT" implements the effect of "Non-disassembly engineering surface technology" – it demonstrates pronounced anti-wear properties towards the friction surfaces of the "wheel-rail" pair and "repair-restorative" abilities towards the friction surfaces of the cylinder-piston pump parts.<br>
        <br>The compensation degree of the mentioned units' resource, depending on operating conditions, can reach up to five times (test report is available upon request).
        "MARIOL NT" is the only lubricating material in the world with "controlled" tribological properties, "the higher the load, the more pronounced the anti-wear effect". "MARIOL NT" has the highest in class drop point temperature (
        ≥ 1800°C), maintains its lubricating capability (operability) in a temperature range from minus 35°C to plus 160°C, exhibits good metal adhesion, poorly washed away by water, does not drip from heated surfaces, and much more, making it a universal and unique lubricating material for ridge and rail lubricators in all climatic zones (conditions) of our country and beyond.</div>
</details>
<details>
    <summary>Do manufacturers and developers of ridge lubrication systems recommend the lubricating material "MARIOL NT"?</summary>
    <div>The absolute majority of ridge lubrication systems installed on locomotives of Ukrainian railway transport enterprises are GS-3 and SPP 12-5 types. Developers and manufacturers of these systems recommend the lubricating material "MARIOL NT" for their products (recommendation letters are available upon request). LLC NVF "YUGTEKHNOTRANS", the developer of the ridge lubrication system SPP 12-5, has included "MARIOL NT" and "MARIOL NTs" as the basic lubricating materials in the SPP 12-5 operation manual.</div>
</details>
<details>
    <summary>Is "MARIOL NT" the standard lubricating material for a specific greasing system?</summary>
    <div>"MARIOL NT" is the standard lubricating material for the greasing system SPП 12-5 produced by LLC NVF "YUGTEKHNOTRANS". Its use in the SPП 12-5 system extends the warranty obligations starting from January 2021.</div>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Have there been tests of the lubricating material "MARIOL NT" under the real operating conditions of the rolling stock?</summary>
    <div>As per the directive from the Director of Engineering and Technical Support of PJSC "Ukrzaliznytsia" T.P. Trypolska (dated 24.12.2020, № ЦЦТех-12/476), "MODIFIK" LLC conducted acceptance-operational tests of the "MARIOL NT" lubricating material for wheel flange lubrication systems on regional branches "Odesa Railways" (DEPO TCH-7, Znamianka, DEPO Kupyansk). The tests were conducted according to the requirements of the STP-N 04-009:2017 "Lubricants and Oils for Traction Rolling Stock, Machinery, and Mechanisms of PJSC 'Ukrzaliznytsia'. Admission Procedure". After the tests, "MARIOL NT" was recommended for use in PJSC "Ukrzaliznytsia" by the higher advisory body "UZ".</div>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Does the admission procedure for lubricating materials of PJSC "UKRZALIZNYTSIA" (STP-N 04-009:2017) include an interdepartmental commission as an approving body?</summary>
    <div>No, such an approving body is not included in STP-N 04-009:2017. The document can be found freely available online.</div>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Is the "RS-6" lubricant suitable for locomotive wheel flange lubrication, and can it be compared with semi-fluid lubricants like "MARIOL NT"?</summary>
    <div>No, "RS-6" is a graphite-containing composition for lubricating rail side surfaces using mobile or stationary rail lubricators. It is not related to wheel flange lubrication or locomotive rail lubricators. At the request of PJSC "Ukrzaliznytsia", a prototype of "MARIOL-NT" underwent comparative bench tests with "RS-6". The results showed that "RS-6" demonstrated much lower tribological properties compared to "MARIOL NT" (≥ 200%).</div>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Have tests been conducted on solid lubricating repair-restorative compositions for locomotive air compressors of PJSC "Ukrzaliznytsia"?</summary>
    <div>Yes, such tests have been conducted. After treatment with products from the "Technology of Friction Surface Engineering", the performance of the demonstration compressor KT-6 of locomotive VL8-1276 increased by 17.38% and remained stable for the next eight months without repair. The compressor was then removed from observation due to no further demonstration needs.</div>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Have there been recent studies and comparisons between lubricating material analogs of "MARIOL NT"?</summary>
    <div>Yes, on the order of "UZ", Dniprovskyi National Technical University conducted research on lubricating materials and modern lubrication systems of locomotive wheel sets with the aim of reducing wear of wheel flanges and developing recommendations. The study concluded that materials containing solid lubricating fillers have significantly better tribological properties. "MARIOL NT" was found to have superior wear resistance and lubricating properties compared to other materials.</div>
</details>
<details>
    <summary>How does the proposal from LLC "MODIFIK" differ from the proposals for lubricating materials from dozens of companies that recently approached PJSC "Ukrzaliznytsia"?</summary>
    <div>
        A) LLC "MODIFIK" is the developer of the innovative "Friction Surface Engineering Technology" ("FSET") and is not a manufacturer of lubricating materials. The effect of using "FSET" has been demonstrated by PJSC "Ukrzaliznytsia", and this is not disputed by the company, as indicated in relevant documents.
        <br>
        <br>
        B) PJSC "Ukrzaliznytsia" has decided to continue research on "FSET" for traction rolling stock, particularly in compensating for the resource of high-load friction pairs of locomotive units (Decision of the scientific and technical council "UZ" dated 26.05.2021).
    </div>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Why doesn't PJSC "Ukrzaliznytsia" adopt decisions to use clearly efficient products of the "Friction Surface Engineering Technology" from LLC "MODIFIK"?</summary>
    <div>
        PJSC "Ukrzaliznytsia" once made a technical decision to continue research on our technology and to use the lubricating material "MARIOL NT", but it has not implemented it. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Regarding the product of our technology, such as "MARIOL NT", all testing and technical conditions have been completed. However, "UZ" does not implement it organizationally, although it can do so at any convenient time. Currently, there are no technical barriers preventing its use. However, there is internal unprofessional antagonism and frequent management changes within "UZ". Not using this technology negatively affects the performance of rolling stock, reduces the reliability of units, safety of transportation, and significantly increases the company's energy costs.
        <br>
        <br>
        Regarding lubricating compositions, this product does not fit into the lubrication logic stipulated by PJSC "Ukrzaliznytsia". Therefore, not using the friction surface engineering technology leads to additional operational costs, even though there is a rational way to compensate for the resource.
    </div>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>In your opinion, what is urgently needed today for the procurement and application of the lubricating material "MARIOL NT"?</summary>
    <div>
        According to the requirements of section 9.3 of STP-N 04-009:2017, "The decision of the scientific and technical council on allowing the use of declared lubricants and oils on the rolling stock, machinery, and mechanisms of PJSC 'Ukrzaliznytsia' can be implemented by orders of PJSC 'Ukrzaliznytsia' or amendments to existing regulatory acts by the established procedure", for the implementation of the "Friction Surface Engineering Technology" products from LLC "MODIFIK", and the procurement and application of the lubricating material "MARIOL NT", an order from the Chairman of the Management Board of "UZ" is needed, approximately as follows:
        <br>
